# Multivariate spatial models for lattice data with INLA

The `INLAMSM` package implements several multivariate spatial models for lattice data with `INLA`. Models implemented include multivariate instrisic CAR, multivariate proper CAR and the M-model.


The package can be installed as follows:

```
devtools::install_github("becarioprecario/INLAMSM")
```

A paper that describes the package can be found in the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10804). `R` code to run all the examples can be found [here](https://becarioprecario.github.io/files/Palmi-PeralesF-INLAMSM.R).
